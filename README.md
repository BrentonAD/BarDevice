# BarDevice

A Particle project named BarDevice.
Firmware for bar mounted device, measuring acceleration and pitch.
To be used in conjuction with a [WearableDevice](https://github.com/BrentonAD/SIT730-ProjectPrototype-WearableDevice)

## Description
The firmware of the bar device runs on the configured frequency of the accelerometer. When data form the accelerometer becomes available the tilt is calculated using trigonometry from the x and z-axis acceleration. This information is transmitted through BLE with a specific buffer signature for the wearable device to receive, however if the tilt is beyond an extreme threshold the deviceâ€™s LED will light up. The bar device also aggregates the joint acceleration magnitude data at 32ms intervals and plots it onto the built-in OLED display. The line chart refreshes every four seconds once the screen has been filled.

## Architecture
For the expected connectivty of the system, see circuit schematic below:

![bar-device-circuit-diagram](docs/BarDevicePrototype_schem.png)

The required hardware is as follows:
- Particle Argon
- 3-Axis Accelerometer (MMA8452Q)
- OLED Display (1.3 Inch SH1106)
- LED + Resistor (220Ohms)

## Repository Structure

#### ```/src``` folder:  
This is the source folder that contains the firmware files for your project. It should *not* be renamed. 
Anything that is in this folder when you compile your project will be sent to our compile service and compiled into a firmware binary for the Particle device that you have targeted.

Particle library dependencies are specified in the `project.properties` file referenced below.

#### ```.ino``` file:
This file is the firmware that will run as the primary application on your Particle device. It contains a `setup()` and `loop()` function, and can be written in Wiring or C/C++. For more information about using the Particle firmware API to create firmware for your Particle device, refer to the [Firmware Reference](https://docs.particle.io/reference/firmware/) section of the Particle documentation.

#### ```project.properties``` file:  
This is the file that specifies the name and version number of the libraries that your project depends on. Dependencies are added automatically to your `project.properties` file when you add a library to a project using the `particle library add` command in the CLI or add a library in the Desktop IDE.

## Compiling your project

When you're ready to compile your project, make sure you have the correct Particle device target selected and run `particle compile <platform>` in the CLI or click the Compile button in the Desktop IDE. The following files in your project folder will be sent to the compile service:

- Everything in the `/src` folder, including your `.ino` application file
- The `project.properties` file for your project
- Any libraries stored under `lib/<libraryname>/src`
